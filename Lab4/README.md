## Overview

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used for pattern matching, text manipulation, validation, parsing, and text processing in programming and data analysis. This README provides a brief overview of regex and its key uses.

## Key Uses

- **Pattern Matching:** Find specific text patterns within larger text bodies.
- **Text Manipulation:** Replace or extract parts of strings based on patterns.
- **Validation:** Check if input data matches specified formats (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
- **Parsing:** Extract structured data from text (e.g., CSV files, log files).
- **Text Processing:** Tokenization, stemming, and normalization of text data.

## Importance

Regular expressions are essential for tasks such as data cleaning, validation, and text analysis in software development and data processing workflows. Mastery of regex can significantly enhance your ability to work with textual data efficiently and effectively.

# Objectives:

1. Write and cover what regular expressions are, what they are used for;

2. Below you will find 3 complex regular expressions per each variant. Take a variant depending on your number in the list of students and do the following:

    a. Write a code that will generate valid combinations of symbols conform given regular expressions (examples will be shown).

    b. In case you have an example, where symbol may be written undefined number of times, take a limit of 5 times (to evade generation of extremely long combinations);

    c. **Bonus point**: write a function that will show sequence of processing regular expression (like, what you do first, second and so on)

Write a good report covering all performed actions and faced difficulties.

# Variants:

## Variant 4:

![Variant 4](/Lab4/variant_4_task.png)
Examples of what must be generated:

{SUWWY24, SVWY24, ...}
{LMOOOPPPQ2, LNOOOPQ3, ...}
{RSTWXX, RRRSUWYY, ...}
